# XELIS Difficulty Simulator

This small program has two distincts parts, one is to generate random data (`generate.py`) and the other is to visualize it using Matplotlib (`graph.py`).

## Usage

First, you need to have dependencies installed:
`poetry install`

Then, you can generate data to visualize it.
`poetry run generate.py`

Now that you have a CSV file created (named `attempts.csv`) you can run the following command:
`poetry run graph.py`
